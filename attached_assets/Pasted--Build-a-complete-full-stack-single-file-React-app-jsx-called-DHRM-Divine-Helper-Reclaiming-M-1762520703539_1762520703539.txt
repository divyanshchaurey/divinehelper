"Build a complete, full-stack, single-file React app (.jsx) called DHRM (Divine Helper, Reclaiming Moksha). This is a spiritual wellness app that must be fully functional.

Core Technologies:

Frontend: React (with Hooks) and Tailwind CSS.

Backend: Firebase. Use Firestore for the database and Firebase Authentication (anonymous sign-in) to give each user a unique ID.

AI Model: Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025).

App Features:

Aesthetic: Must have a beautiful, Hindu-inspired aesthetic (saffron, gold, maroon, and cream colors) and be fully responsive.

Multi-Page Navigation: Use React state to manage page navigation between 'Home', 'Divya Drishti', 'DHRM Chat', 'Dhyan', 'Books', and 'About Us'.

Language (i18n): Must support both English ('en') and Hindi ('hi') translations.

Divya Drishti Page:

This page must fetch a random quote from a public Firestore collection (/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/drishtiQuotes).

The page should have a 'New Drishti' button to fetch another random quote.

Dhyan (Meditation) Page:

Implement a 10-minute countdown timer with 'Start', 'Pause', and 'Reset' buttons.

When 'Start' is pressed, play a looping, soothing audio file from a provided URL.

Pause the audio when 'Pause' or 'Reset' is clicked.

DHRM Chat (Core AI Feature):

This must be a functional chat interface that connects to the Gemini API.

System Instruction: The AI must act as a 'Vedic-grounded philosophical coach,' providing wise, calm, and supportive answers based on ancient scriptures.

Grounding: The AI must use the Google Search grounding tool to ensure its answers are based on verifiable sources (like the Bhagavad Gita, Vedas, Upanishads).

Citations: Every answer from the AI must include a source citation (e.g., '(Bhagavad Gita, 2.47)').

Chat History: Save the entire chat history (user and AI messages) to a private Firestore collection specific to the user (/artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/chatHistory).

Books Page:

Create a public Firestore collection (/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/books) to store the text of holy books.

This page should list the books. Clicking a book opens a modal and displays the text fetched from Firestore.

Contact Us Page:

Create a functional 'Contact Us' form.

On submit, the form must save the message to a public Firestore collection (/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/contactMessages)."
